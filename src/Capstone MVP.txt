Pitch/Idea 

I plan to create an e-commerse website to build the ultimate fictional fighting team. 
A user will be able to log into my website, and be able to "shop" around for different cartoon
cartoon, video game, cereal mascots, and anime characters and add them to their shopping cart.
Each character will have different attacks and skills, so you want to have an eclectic group
of fighters on your team.  They will be able to add these characters to their cart and check 
out on another webpage.
